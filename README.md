What is a loan?

A loan is anything loaned to another person in exchange for future repayment of the loan value plus interest and other financing charges, whether it be property, money, or other tangible items. A loan can be obtained as an open-ended line of credit with a set maximum or for a fixed, one-time sum. There are many various types of loans, including unsecured, secured, commercial, and personal loans.


Understanding loans

A loan is a debt that a person or an organization incurs. A lender is the other party to the transaction; typically, it is a government agency, financial institution, or business. They lend the borrower the necessary amount of money. In exchange, the borrowers consent to pay a specific set of conditions, such as any finance fees, interest, etc., using the money they initially borrowed.


How does the loan process work?

You apply for a loan from a business or a bank when you need money. You must supply particular information, including the reason you need the loan, as well as your financial background, Social Security Number (SSN), and other facts that may differ from lender to lender.
In order to determine if you can afford to repay the loan, the lender will examine your application and look at your debt-to-income ratio. The lender will either accept or reject your application based on it. If your application is turned down, the lender is required to give a justification.
A contract between you and the lender is signed if your application is accepted. The loan amount, together with interest and other fees, are sent to your account by the lender.
Before a loan contract is completed and funds are dispersed, certain terms must be agreed upon by both parties. The loan paperwork will specify any requirements for collateral, which the lender may in some circumstances require. The majority of loans also include clauses defining the maximum rate of interest and the grace period before repayment is necessary.


Why and when loans are given?

Loans are given out for a variety of reasons. A borrower can require a loan to finance a purchase, debt relief, business endeavors, home improvements, or investing. Business loans can support a company's expansion.
Loans, in other words, enable the expansion of an economy's total money supply and promote competition by funding new enterprises. Lenders (banks) receive income from the interest and other fees they charge borrowers.


An important factor while taking a loan

Interest rates are one of the most crucial considerations for a borrower when taking out a loan. In comparison to loans with lower interest rates, loans with higher interest rates will cost the borrower more money since they require larger monthly payments or take longer to be repaid. For instance, if you take out a term loan for $5,000 over five years at a 4.5% interest rate, your monthly payment for the following five years will be $93.22. If your interest rate is 9%, on the other hand, you will need to fork over $103.79 for the same time period.
Let us understand it differently. If you have taken a loan of  $10,000and the interest rate is  6% and you decide to pay  $200 per month, you need to pay for 58 months to clear off your loan or balance. With  20% interest, and the same balance and monthly payment, it will take 108 months to pay off the loan.


Dataset Problems
An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product. They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is riskier and who is not.
